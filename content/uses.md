## Hardware

### Desktop Equipment

- **Custom Desktop PC:**
  - **CPU**: [AMD Ryzen 5 9600X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-5-9600x.html) - I find this CPU to be the best balance of performance and price. It uses AM5 socket so I could upgrade it later.
  - **Motherboard**: [MSI MAG B850M Mortar WiFi](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-B850M-MORTAR-WIFI/Specification) - This motherboard is a little bit expensive compared to other options, but it offers WiFi 7 supports and i need this because i do not have an Ethernet on the wall.
  - **RAM**: 32GB DDR5 (6000 MHz CL30) - I bought this RAM just before the RAM market crashed. I could have buy only 16GB, but I got a great deal on this one.
  - Storage - 2TB NVMe SSD
  - **GPU**: [Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 9060 XT](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/nitro-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16g-gddr6) - I bought this GPU because I wanted an AMD GPU for better Linux compatibility. I bought the Nitro+ version because it was on sale and I really like the design.
  - **Case**: [Lian Li Dan A3](https://lian-li.com/product/a3-matx) - I picked this case because I wanted a small form factor with good airflow. It is great but it was a little bit difficult for a first build because of the number of possible configurations.
  - CPU Cooler - Noctua NH-D15
  - Power Supply - Corsair SFX 850W
- **Keyboard:** [Nuphy Air75 V3](https://nuphy.com/products/nuphy-air75-v3) - I really enjoy this low profile keyboard. It has wired, wireless, and Bluetooth support. I picked the silent switches to be able to use this keyboard in an open-space at work.
