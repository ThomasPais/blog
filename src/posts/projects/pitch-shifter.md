- Preserve tempo and duration

Bad 
- Atonal / Inharmonic artefacts
- Echoey or diffuse sound (transients)
- Fluttery or robotic sound


# Time domain

## Similarity with a Time Stretcher
Good
- Change tempo and duration
- Preserve pitch

Bad

### Pitch Shifter = Time Stretcher
Time Stretcher => Pitch Shifter  :

 We can pass from a Time Stretcher to a Pitch Shifter by stretching time and changing playback rate

Pitch Shifter => Time Stretcher :

Similarly we can pass from a Pitch Shifter to a Time Shifter by changing the playback rate and shifting the pitch
