<h1 class="title">Hello, I'm Thomas Païs.</h1>
<p>
  I'm an electronics engineer from France and working in the space industry. For
  work, I design and test systems on FPGA and ASIC. At home, I enjoy free and
  open source software, Linux, computers and tinkering.

<p>
  I built this space to share content I hope others will find useful. I also
  maintain a few projects in my spare time - you can check them out in the
  projects section.
